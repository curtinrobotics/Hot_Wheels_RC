## Project Structure

```
Hot_Wheels_RC/
├── src/
│   ├── esp32/              → ESP32 source code
│   ├── arduino/            → Arduino source code
|   ├── hardware_design/    → Hardware design files
└── doc/                    → Documentation for both codebases
```

## Collaboration Guidelines

To ensure smooth teamwork:

- **Commit, pull, and push frequently** to keep everyone on the same page.
- **Create a branch** for any experimental or testing-specific changes. Once stable, we can discuss merging them into the main codebase.
- If you have questions, feel free to reach out to Aron or Joshan
