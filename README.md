## Project Structure

```
Hot_Wheels_RC/
├── archive/                    -> archival assests, may be still relevant
├── docs/                       -> Documentation for the project
├── hardware_design/            -> CAD and schematic files for the hardware components
│   ├── Hot_Wheels_3d_model/    -> 3D model exported files (e.g., .stl, .step) for manufacturing and prototyping
│   └── Hot_Wheels_3d_model.f3d -> Fusion 360 CAD file (requires Fusion 360 to open)
├── Hot_Wheels_arduino_firmware/ -> Arduino firmware source code
```

## Collaboration Guidelines

To ensure smooth teamwork:

- **Commit, pull, and push frequently** to keep everyone on the same page.
- **Create a branch** for any experimental or testing-specific changes. Once stable, we can discuss merging them into the main codebase.
- If you have questions, feel free to reach out to Aron or Joshan
